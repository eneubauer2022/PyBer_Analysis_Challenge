# PyBer_Analysis_Challenge

## Purpose 

After analyzing some exploratory data for PyBer - a ride sharing app company, we wanted to summarize and create a compelling visualization for the results. This will help the executives of PyBer improve access and determine the affordability for their ride sharing services.

## Resources
- city_data.csv

- ride_data.csv

## Software
- Python 3.7.6

- Matplotlib 3.5.1

- Pandas 1.4.2

- Jupyter Notebook

## Results:

- Urban cities collected the most amount of total rides and total amount of fares - producing the most amount of revenue for PyBer. However, they also had the lowest average fare per driver and had more total drivers than total rides - indicating that the supply of drivers outweighs the demand in Urban cities. The average fare per ride was the lowest of all three types - which could indicate that the trips are shorter in Urban cities. 

- In contrast, Rural cities had the lowest total rides and lowest total fares. But their average fare per driver was for Rural drivers was almost 3 times as much than the Urban drivers. This indicates that the demand for drivers in Rural cities is much higher than the supply - the Rural drivers are generating almost 1.5 times more rides per driver than in Urban cities where some drivers may not be capturing any rides. The average fare per ride was the highest of all three types - possibility indicating that the Rural drivers were taking customers much farther distances on their trips. 

- While Suburban cities had more Total Rides than Total Drivers, it was not as extreme as the Rural Cities - there was still a higher demand than supply in those cities. Suburban drivers saw a higher average fare than Urban cities but not nearly the same as Rural cities. The Average fare per ride was higher than Urban, it was still lower than Rural average fare. Suburban drivers may be driving customers farther distances than the Urban city drivers, but not as far as Rural city drivers.

- Reviewing the data generated by city type by month - all three city types saw an increase in fares at the end of February and then a drop off in March. While the fares for Rural and Suburban seemed to stay somewhat consistent from March to April - Urban cities saw a fluctuation in their fares; their fares had more peaks and drop-offs during that same time frame. 

## Summary:

- Based on the results, since all three city types saw a drop in fares at the end of February, I recommend we continue to explore other data points to understand what caused this outcome. If we could pinpoint the causation, it might be a factor we can control in the future to prevent a similar outcome for all city types. However, without more analysis it is hard to determine what actions can be taken. 

- PyBer should also invest in hiring more drivers in Rural and Suburban areas to offset the demand. There are more total rides in these city types than drivers - which may frustrate customers if they cannot obtain a driver in a timely manner. This may decrease the average fare per driver but will result in higher customer satisfaction for the company. 

- The company should also review how many total drivers they have in Urban cities and see if they can redirect some of those drivers to serve other city types. They could encourage Urban drivers to expand their base to serve suburban or rural areas. This would help decrease the saturation of drivers in Urban areas but help with the demand of more drivers in Rural/Suburban areas. Drivers in Urban areas would be able to generate more rides per driver and customers in these areas would have more drivers available to offer rides.
